# Mini-Search-Engine

This project aimed to build a powerful web search engine that utilizes what we have learned in this course. The search engine was designed with a crawler that crawled one million diverse web documents using a distributed implementation of Stormlite, and used Hadoop to build a comprehensive lexicon that correctly maps words to documents to effectively answer queries. We also developed an effective PageRank algorithm to sort pages based on authoritativeness using Apache Spark and deployed a search engine that has a user-friendly interface and outputs search results indicative of authoritativeness & proximity to the given query within seconds. The search engine was deployed on AWS using Dynamodb and EC2, ensuring scalability of the system.
